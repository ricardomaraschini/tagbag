This command pushes a previously pulled tarball to a registry. The tarball
layers are pushed as-is, without any modification. The tarball must have
been previously pulled with the pull command. The --authfile option can be
used to provide the credentials when pushing to a registry that requires
authentication:

$ tagbag push                \
        --authfile auth.json \
        --source images.tgz  \
        --destination docker.io/myaccount

All images are pushed to the same repository. You can also overlay a diff
tarball on top of the images prior to pushing them:

$ tagbag push                            \
        --source v1.0.0.tgz              \
        --overlay overlay.tgz            \
        --destination docker.io/myaccount

On this case overlay.tgz will be lay down on top of v1.0.0.tgz and then
pushed to the registry. The overlay tarball must have been previously
created with the diff command.
