This command calculates and stores the difference between two previouly
pulled tarballs. Here we use v1.0.0.tgz as base and we compare it with
v2.0.0.tgz. The content present in v2.0.0.tgz but not in v1.0.0.tgz is
stored in overlay.tgz:

$ tagbag diff               \
        --source v1.0.0.tgz \
        --target v2.0.0.tgz \
        --output overlay.tgz

This overlay.tgz can then be used when pulling to a registry that already
contains v1.0.0 stored.
